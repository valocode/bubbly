# Bubbly Docs

The bubbly docs are built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

The deployment is automated using GitHub Actions. Check the [GitHub workflow](../.github/workflows/docs-build-deploy.yaml)
