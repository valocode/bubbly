Resources are the most important element in the Bubbly language. Each resource block describes one or more data pipeline object, such as data extractors or data transformers.

- [Core Concepts: Resources](../introduction/core-concepts#resources) introduces the concept of resources.
  
- [Resource Kinds](./kinds) documents the available set of resources, their
  specifications and example usage.
  
- [Tutorials: Getting Started](../tutorials/github-metrics) provides a practical tutorial for getting started
  with Bubbly.
