The GraphQL API is exposed at `<BUBBLY_URL>/graphql`.

Bubbly uses [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) for its GraphQL implementation which comes with a playground which can be found at `<BUBBLY_URL>/playground`.

We recommend using the playground to explore the schema and test queries.

## Examples

TODO - create a few test queries
